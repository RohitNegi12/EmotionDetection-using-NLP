# EmotionDetection-using-NLP

This web app uses a language model from Hugging Face to analyze the sentiments in product reviews (provided as a .csv file) and allows users to analyze customer reviews in the form of a pie chart. The "Word Cloud" page provides high-frequency words in the reviews, allowing the user to analyze the cause of the sentiment.
